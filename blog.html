            <h3>Blog 1 12/10/2021</h3>
            <p>Due to wanting to live closer to the city centre, I moved from my
              house in second year to a flat in the city centre for third year.
              Moving back to Liverpool was great; I felt like I was coming
              home, much to my parents’ displeasure!</p>
          </li>

           <h3>Blog 2 01/02/2022</h3>
           <p>For the first week back, I worked a few days for the university in
            my job as an Ambassador, showing potential new students
            round while becoming reacquainted with the campus myself.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
           <h3>Blog 3 23/04/2022</h3>
           <p>Students from older years had warned me about third year being pretty scary, so I had prepared well
            and really enjoyed the first lectures from my new modules. Reconnecting with my societies was
            doubly fun, being the President of Combined Honours for the year meant lots of summer
            preparation for our first social – which was a big hit!/p>
